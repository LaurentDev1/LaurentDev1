- 👋 Hi, I’m @LaurentDev1
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things from listening to a plethora of music genres (dance, rap, rock, soul, jazz, you name it), riding motorcycle, 
mountainbiking, hiking. Besides that always had an interest in web development and the digital world in general, which I want to put into practice now!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning general webdevelopment > HTML/CSS and JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing particular at the moment, but who knows what the future will bring
- 📫 How to reach me? send me a DM. Can you send DM's on Github? ;-)
